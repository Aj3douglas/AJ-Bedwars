<h1>AJ Bedwars</h1>
The game process:

A player executes `/bedwars join`, If a game doesnt exist, one is made.
All players then wait in a waiting room area, specified in the config. 
Once either the maximum players(8) is reached, or a timer runs out
(defined in config). All players waiting are given a team at random, and are teleported 
to their respective islands, co ords are defined in the config. Teams are single players only.
Players can buy blocks, weapons, and similar from a villager at their island, or at others.
Players can buy upgrades to their island, speed on island etc from a villager
Iron spawns once every x(defined in config) seconds per team at a location defined in the config.
Same for gold. Diamonds spawn at generator locations defined in the config (Not per team). Same for emeralds.
After x amount of time(defined in config) the speed at which generators will be upgraded to the tier 2 speed in the config.
This is repeated up until tier 4 (The maximum tier). Once a user breaks another users bed the user can then no longer
respawn. If a player whos bed is broken dies they are put in spectator mode, given a compass they can use to teleport to other users.
